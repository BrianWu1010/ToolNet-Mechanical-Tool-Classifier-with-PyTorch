# ToolNet-Mechanical-Tool-Classifier-with-PyTorch
In this project, I built and trained neural networks using PyTorch to classify images of mechanical tools into 8 categories (e.g., hammer, wrench, pliers). The goal was to deepen my understanding of neural network architectures, training loops, and model evaluation.

What I Did

Developed a feedforward neural network (ANN) from scratch and implemented the full training pipeline

Used PyTorch to manage data loading, batching, model definition, loss computation, and optimization

Experimented with hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of hidden layers

Visualized training and validation loss to monitor overfitting and underfitting

Compared model performance between a basic ANN and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Gained practical experience distinguishing between training, validation, and test splits

Key Learnings

How to structure and implement the training loop in PyTorch

The effect of hyperparameter tuning on model convergence and generalization

Differences in performance and feature extraction between ANNs and CNNs

The importance of model evaluation using validation/test sets and loss visualization
